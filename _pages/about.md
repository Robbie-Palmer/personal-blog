Hi, my name is Robbie.

I plan to sporadically write about my interests, which include:

- Personal finance
- Data science
- Software engineering
- Economics
- Bioinformatics
- Leadership
- Product development
- Philosophy
- People/places/food

Many of these tie in with my current career path, others with my personal life,
and the rest are included out of pure curiosity.

The recent advances in machine learning can have a huge impact on drug discovery, cancer diagnostics and research.
As with all technological leaps forward, it requires a huge transition from the previous way of working.
I've spent the past few years working on digital and computational pathology,
and hope to help make that transition happen as fast and as effectively as possible.
My main focus is on applying computer vision techniques to images of digitised biopsies.
This can be used to automate tedious tasks to free up valuable time of clinicians and researchers;
but what excites me even more is the insights that are not possible without automation.

My interest in personal finance has came from planning to buy a house and changing my mind
thanks to discovering the Financial Independence community (or FIRE - Financial Independence Retire Early).

An interest in politics, led to an interest in economics, which led to an interest in philosophy,
and how to think, which led to Epistemology (knowledge about knowledge).
These are subjects I find it fun to think about in a meta way.
They're not my bread and butter so I have limited knowledge about them, but hope exploring them,
and writing about them can refine my thoughts!
