    <p>Buying a house is the worst decision I nearly made.</p>

<p>I nearly did it because it is what people expect me to do.</p>

<p>It seems sensible too.</p>

<p>You’re paying for your landlord’s retirement.</p>

<p>Being a landlord is profitable.</p>

<p>They’re obviously profitable at your expense.</p>

<p>Your parents and grandparents tell you their homes are worth 5-10x what they 
paid.</p>

<p>They’re horrified by your rent.</p>

<p>Their mortgage repayments are a fraction of this.</p>

<p><strong>All of this is true</strong>.</p>

<p>If you buy a house you <em>will</em> save <em>hundreds of thousands</em> of pounds over
your lifetime, <strong>versus doing nothing</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="you-dont-have-to-do-nothing">You don’t have to do nothing</h3>

<p>If you’re considering buying a house for financial reasons,
there are alternatives that are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>More effective AND</li>
  <li>Less risky AND</li>
  <li>Easier (including more accessible)</li>
</ol>

<p>I knew there were lifestyle reasons to not buy a house,
but I thought the financial gain was worth the sacrifice.</p>

<p>I was not aware of these alternatives.</p>

<p>Researching the alternatives changed my perspective of housing and changed my
mind.</p>

<h3 id="it-might-change-yours-too">It might change yours too</h3>

<h2 id="housing-folklore">Housing Folklore</h2>

<p>When I wanted to buy a house, I missed that I was looking for an investment.</p>

<p>I did not understand that houses are just like any other investment.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of folk-lore and spin surrounding housing in the UK and USA.</p>

<p>People commonly say rent is “throwing away” your money, which they don’t say
about other spending.</p>

<p>People talk about about climbing the “property ladder”.</p>

<p>Politicians talk about generations who get “left behind” because they couldn’t
get on that first rung.</p>

<p>No one talks about other types of investment “ladders”.</p>

<p>No one points out that it is the lack of <em>general</em> savings and investments
(and other systematic factors) that holds back social mobility.</p>

<p>There is nothing specific about houses.</p>

<p><em>Placing a deposit on a house is <strong>an alternative</strong> to investing that deposit.</em></p>

<p><em>Placing a deposit on a house is <strong>the same</strong> as investing that deposit.</em></p>

<p><em>Placing a deposit on a house is <strong>less effective, riskier, harder and restricts
your life more</strong> than investing that deposit.</em></p>

<p>It isn’t only home-owners and landlords that grow their wealth.</p>

<p>I think the reason we miss this is that buying a house feels familiar and
comfortable.</p>

<p>If I bought a house then wanted to move but keep my investment;
becoming a landlord would also feel familiar and comfortable.</p>

<p>Cash and houses. They’re part of normal life.</p>

<p>I didn’t understand that <strong>holding cash is an investment</strong> (a terrible one at 
that).</p>

<p>I knew nothing of bonds or REITs.</p>

<p>Stocks are what crazy gung-ho risk takers gamble on with their millions right?</p>

<p>To me, these were intimidating ideas, not accessible to someone like me.</p>

<p>None of my friends or family know much about investing.</p>

<p>Their only investments are their houses and their pensions.</p>

<p>Pensions are black box magic.</p>

<p>Many view them as a special savings account the government tops up.</p>

<p>Houses are long term homes.</p>

<p>They happen to have a side effect of building equity.</p>

<p>I didn’t know that <strong>we all</strong>* own stocks, bonds and REITs through our pensions
already.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A stock is partial ownership of a company.
You are entitled to part of their profits.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A bond is ownership of someone else’s debt.
You are entitled to full repayment of this loan with interest.
You can sell ownership of this loan before it is fully repaid.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A REIT is a Real Estate Investment Trust.
Through this trust you have partial ownership of real estate.
This is usually commerical property but may include residential property.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you are younger, your pension will mostly be a diversified set of stocks.
These are the best asset for growing your wealth.</p>

<p>As you get older your pension shifts to bonds.</p>

<p>These are less volatile than stocks.
They are better at maintaining any existing wealth.</p>

<p>This is important as you approach retirement having added money throughout your
career.</p>

<p>Finally your pension shifts to cash so you can withdraw and spend it.</p>

<p>Thanks to Index Funds, we can all benefit from this process without knowing 
much anything about it.</p>

<p>A normal person with very limited financial knowledge can put their money in an
index fund and study after study shows they’ll beat Wall Street traders over
a 10+ year period.</p>

<p>I want to show how buying assets in an index fund is
<em>more effective, less risky <strong>AND</strong> easier</em> than buying a house.</p>

<h2 id="easier">Easier</h2>

<p>Investing in an index fund (once you know what they are and how to choose one)
is as easy as opening a savings account.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Register with <a href="https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/">Vanguard</a> online</li>
  <li>Transfer money into your account (current minimum lump sum investment is £500)</li>
  <li>Invest it into a
<a href="https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/what-we-offer/life-strategy-products">LifeStrategy fund</a>
choosing the balance between stocks and bonds based on how long you will keep your money invested</li>
</ul>

<p>Investing in a house is famously one of the most stressful and difficult things
you will ever do.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vivopropertybuyers.co.uk/vivo-property-buyers-uk-survey/">Ranked more stressful than having a baby</a></p>

<p>You need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Save a large sum of cash (orders of magnitudes larger than £500)</li>
  <li>Get pre-approved for a mortgage via a mortgage broker</li>
  <li>Optionally find a real estate agent</li>
  <li>House hunt</li>
  <li>Submit an offer &amp; haggle / compete with other bidders</li>
  <li>Organise professional home inspection and appraisal</li>
  <li>Final paperwork, pay closing costs, property tax, transaction fees, get insurance…</li>
  <li>Move house</li>
</ul>

<p>This process takes months and can be further stalled by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Struggling to find a suitable house</li>
  <li>Mortgage application rejection</li>
  <li>Losing out on a bid (including getting
<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/gazump">Gazumped</a> after your offer was accepted)</li>
  <li>Bad results from a professional home inspection</li>
  <li>Sellers pulling out of the deal</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.vivopropertybuyers.co.uk/reasons-to-sell-to-vivo-broken-property-chains/">Broken property chain</a></li>
  <li>Down-valuation by lender</li>
</ul>

<p>Common reasons for mortgage application rejection:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You recently changed jobs</li>
  <li>You’re not registered to vote</li>
  <li>Administrative errors on your credit file</li>
  <li>You don’t match the lenders target demographic</li>
  <li>Your income is too low (counted after tax and deductions even if you could reduce deductions such as your pension contribution)</li>
  <li>You’re self employed or a contractor</li>
  <li>You recently applied for a credit card</li>
  <li>You took a payday loan in the last 6 years</li>
  <li>Your deposit is too small</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="less-risky">Less Risky</h2>

<p>Investing in an index fund is less risky than investing in a house.</p>

<h3 id="diversification">Diversification</h3>

<p>Diversification is the key to managing risk.</p>

<p>“Don’t Put All Your Eggs in One Basket” - A wise grandmother</p>

<p>A house could not be less diverse.</p>

<p>It is in a single country, county/state, city/town, neighbourhood, street…</p>

<p>The value of your house will be affected by anything from global events to
something a single neighbour does.</p>

<p>When you buy a house you’re also buying a single type of house
(apartment, semi-detached, detached), with a certain style
(open-plan, large windows…).</p>

<p>The prices for these will fluctuate based on fashion.</p>

<p>Index funds automatically diversify your investment.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-ftse-global-all-cap-index-fund-gbp-acc/portfolio-data">Global Stocks Index Fund</a>
invests in over 6700 companies spanning more than 42 countries.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-global-aggregate-bond-ucits-etf-gbp-hedged-distributing/portfolio-data?intcmpgn=fixedincomeglobal_globalaggregatebonducitsetf_fund_link">Global Bonds Index Fund</a>
spreads over 4900 debtors which include governments, companies, agencies etc.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.charles-stanley-direct.co.uk/ViewFund?Sedol=B5BFJG7">Global REIT Index Fund</a>
invests in many properties in more than 10 countries.</p>

<p>You cannot be any more diversified than that.</p>

<p>Everyone knows it’s risky to buy stocks in a single company.</p>

<p>Everyone ignores that it’s risky to invest in a single house.</p>

<h3 id="liquidity">Liquidity</h3>

<p>Saying an investment is liquid or illiquid is a fancy way of saying it’s easy
or hard to turn it into cash.</p>

<p>You need liquidity to deal with unexpected emergencies.</p>

<p>You never know when something bad will happen that requires a lot of cash.</p>

<p>You may be out of a job for a long time.</p>

<p>You may suddenly need to support a dependent.</p>

<p>All your belongings may spontaneously combust and need replaced.</p>

<p>A house is incredibly illiquid.</p>

<p>You cannot turn the money you invested into your house into cash as needed.</p>

<p>To access this money as cash you have to sell your house.</p>

<p>This takes months and involves a massive life upheaval.</p>

<h2 id="more-effective">More Effective</h2>

<p>The stock market has historically grown at a higher rate than house prices.</p>

<p>The trick to take advantage of this is to set up a standing order to invest 
regularly and ignore scare-mongering financial news stories.</p>

<p>Leave it alone, forget about it, feel no stress and you’re set to go.</p>

<p>Sustaining the returns from a house requires lots of effort and stress.</p>

<p>To simply stop your house from decreasing in value you must carry out repairs, 
maintenance, redecoration and general home improvements.</p>

<p>This additional investment means that house prices do not reflect the whole
story, and the return on investment for home ownership is lower than house
prices suggest.</p>

<p>House prices don’t take into account <em>additional costs</em> required for
maintenance.</p>

<p>Stock prices don’t take into account <em>additional returns</em> on investment you 
receive through dividends.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dividends are your share of the company’s profits.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="but-what-about-recessions">But what about recessions?</h3>

<p>The Great Depression started with the worst stock market crash.</p>

<p>If you were <em>extraordinarily</em> unlucky and invested <em>only</em> at the <em>peak</em> before
the crash, your investment would have
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/your-money/stocks-and-bonds/26stra.html#:~:text=HISTORICAL%20stock%20charts%20seem%20to,times%20in%20the%20current%20downturn.">recovered in 7.5 years</a>.</p>

<p>If your luck was even slightly better, investing before and after the peak
(especially during the trough), you would have your money back <em>much much</em>
quicker.</p>

<p>That was the worst stock market crash we have ever had.</p>

<p>House prices are also affected by recessions.</p>

<p>The huge decrease in house prices caused the Great Recession of 2007/2008.</p>

<p>People over-valued houses just as they often over value companies,
and the bubble burst when they realised the prices had got out of hand.</p>

<p>If you’re willing to keep your money invested in a house for a long time,
then you should be willing to do the same with stocks to ride out these bumps.</p>

<h2 id="lifestyle">Lifestyle</h2>

<p>So buying a house is one of the most stressful things you can do, it is 
ridiculously difficult; it is a risky investment; and it performs worse than
alternatives.</p>

<p>So why might you buy a house?</p>

<p>For lifestyle reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You enjoy DIY, and your landlord prevents you from getting your hands dirty 
on home projects (it is possible to find landlords who will allow this)</li>
  <li>You want to live in the same location for a very long period of time,
setting down roots, being part of the community,
building a sentimental attachment to your home 
(still possible while renting, but there is a risk the landlord will evict you)</li>
  <li>You want to live in a specific location / in a specific style of house and 
cannot find something that meets this criteria on the rental market
(a problem I’m currently facing)</li>
  <li>You have found a house that is undervalued to such a degree it makes up for
the financial downsides and lifestyle restrictions
(you must know something no one else does or be incredibly lucky)</li>
  <li>You want a pet, cannot find somewhere to rent that allows pets and are willing
to make huge sacrifices to have one (my girlfriend)</li>
  <li>You have a history of terrible landlords and desperately need to take back
control</li>
</ul>

<p>Buying a house does not make sense if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You don’t want to maintain a house</li>
  <li>You want the flexibility to move locations, such as to other 
towns/cities/countries (or away from bad neighbourhoods)</li>
  <li>You want to adjust the size of your house as needed</li>
  <li>You want to get upgrades to appliances and decor with limited disruption
(assuming moving to a newly refurbished house is less disruption than 
refurbishing one you live in)</li>
  <li>You want to (relatively) easily build wealth</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2>

<p>The first time I questioned my decision to buy a house was when I read
<a href="https://jlcollinsnh.com/2013/05/29/why-your-house-is-a-terrible-investment/">Why your house is a terrible investment</a>
by JL Collins.</p>

<p>That article also sparked my interest in learning about investments.</p>

<p>The same author has written a <a href="https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/">Stock Series</a>
of articles, discussing investments (primarily stocks but also bonds and REITs)
which was so popular he used it as a basis for his book
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1533667926/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1533667926&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jlcollinsnh-20&amp;linkId=1b236a42ef2205f07c4e83e9a984bd17">The Simple Path to Wealth</a>.</p>

<p>JL Collins is popular in the Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE) movement.</p>

<p>Reading about this led me to discover other interesting figures in the world of
personal finance such as
<a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/">Mr Money Moustache</a>.</p>

<p>The leading figures in this community have interesting ideas that challenge the
norm.</p>

<p>If you believe buying a house will be a more effective investment, and you’re
not put off by the difficulty, the risk and the lifestyle impacts,
I would recommend running the numbers.</p>

<p><a href="https://affordanything.com/is-renting-better-than-buying-should-i-rent-or-buy/">Renting Is Throwing Money Away … Right?</a>
runs through the complicated process of modelling your expected returns vs the
alternatives.
The conclusion is as with everything, <em>it depends</em>.
Namely on: price to rent ratio, time invested, assumptions about inflation,
expected costs, how fast rents increase etc. etc.</p>

<p>JL Collins also has a
<a href="https://jlcollinsnh.com/2012/02/23/rent-v-owning-your-home-opportunity-cost-and-running-some-numbers/">run the numbers</a>
with links to many other articles that aim to do the same.</p>

<p>At the time of writing interest rates in the UK are at 0.1%.
I assumed this means it is a great time to buy a house, as mortgages could
hardly be cheaper.</p>

<p><a href="https://patrick.net/post/1282720/2015-07-11-ten-reasons-it-s-a-terrible-time-to-buy-an-expensive-house">Ten Reasons It’s A Terrible Time To Buy An Expensive House</a>
made me realise that of course it’s not that simple!</p>

<p>The author states that it’s better to buy with a high interest rate.</p>

<p>The theory goes that a low interest rate causes house prices to rise.
Prices will fall when interest rates rise, which we assume will happen 
eventually given how ridiculously low they currently are.</p>

<p>When house prices fall, you lose your equity but not your debt.</p>

<p>Markets aren’t so simple, who knew <img class="emoji" title=":man_shrugging:" alt=":man_shrugging:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f937-2642.png" height="20" width="20"></p>
