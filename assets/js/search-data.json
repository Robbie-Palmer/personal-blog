            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. .",

          "content": "Hi, my name is Robbie. . I plan to sporadically write about my interests, which include: . Personal finance | Data science | Software engineering | Economics | Bioinformatics | Leadership | Product development | Philosophy | People/places/food | . Many of these tie in with my current career path, others with my personal life, and the rest are included out of pure curiosity. . Machine Learning for Healthcare . The recent advances in machine learning will have a huge impact on drug discovery, cancer diagnostics and research. As with all technological leaps forward, it will require an overhaul in the way of working for all those in the field. . I’ve spent the past few years working on digital and computational pathology, and hope to help make that transition happen as fast and as effectively as possible. . My main focus is on applying computer vision techniques to images of digitised biopsies. This can free up the valuable time of clinicians and researchers by automating tedious tasks; but what will be really transformative are the new insights that are not possible without automation. . Finance . My interest in personal finance has came from planning to buy a house and changing my mind thanks to discovering the Financial Independence community or FIRE movement. . Nerdisms . An interest in politics, led to an interest in economics, which led to an interest in philosophy. Philosophy spiked my interest in how to think, which recently led to Epistemology (knowledge about knowledge). . These are super-meta subjects I find it fun to think about. I have limited knowledge about them, but I hope exploring them and writing about them can refine my thoughts. . Contact Me . If you have similar interests, want to chat or give feedback, you can leave a comment on the relevant post, or DM me on Twitter. .",
