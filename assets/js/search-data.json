            "content": "Market conditions are forcing us to make a break with managerial practices of the past. . Labour’s efficiency growth has been dominating productivity since the industrial revolution. Previously, investments in physical capital (such as roads) drove productivity. The industrial revolution marked the moment when there was humongous growth of output per worker, without the corresponding investment in physical capital. . This has been driven by an era of industrial capitalism, characterised by the division of labour to enable specialisation and the routinisation of work tasks. As the non-creative parts of tasks become disentangled from the creative parts, they can increasingly be made more efficient by applying standardised processes, semi-automation and eventually total automation. These efficiency gains apply a selection pressure, driving further splitting of tasks into creative and non-creative parts. . In the modern era following the industrial revolution the creativity in business was done at the strategic management level of existing businesses or by entrepreneurs for new businesses. . An entrepreneur would discover a re-arrangement of tasks that enabled these efficiency protocols, and setup an organisation to exploit this discovery to undercut their competitors in the market, or to enable the birth of a new market that was previously economically inaccessible. E.g. Henry Ford being inspired by the “dis-assembly” line in a slaughterhouse, setup an assembly line for automobile construction. . Managers hire non-creative labour to plug the holes in the process where creative and non-creative work are still coupled, or where an economically viable, totally automated solution for some non-creative work has not yet been found. . In the past, creatives were ignored if they had no power / authority. They head no means by which to enact their creations. Only those with financial backing and social status could bring their creations to life in broad markets, often employing labourers. . As technology has advanced, we continue to discover ever more efficient methodologies and build ever more powerful tools. This has led to reorganisations occurring and non-creative work vanishing at an astonishing rate. . A positive feedback loop has been kicked off. New efficiencies, lead to more efficently discovering new efficiencies. . Discovering and implementing efficiencies enables us to discover and implement meta-efficiencies. . As the discovery of efficiency protocols accelerates, non-creative labour is disappearing and new creative work is being created. That being, the creative work of generating these efficiency protocols. . Labour is increasingly shifting to be the process of creatively disrupting existing labour. . Strategic management continues to be creative, but the growth in creativity is happening with the labourers; and management is struggling to adapt to this change. . To creatively generate efficiency protocols, a holistic overview of the whole system is required. Specialisation and tight focus hinders creativity. Generalism and holism drives creativity. . This contrasts sharply with the methodology of the division of labour that drove modern industrial capitalism. . The goal of [creatives] is not to execute. Rather, the goal is to learn and develop profound new business capabilities. . The managerial practices of the modern era are becoming increasingly defunct in our contemporary post-modern or metamodern society. . Organisations that employ modernist managerial practices will stifle the business innovation and employee growth required to compete in an increasingly creative market. . Adam Smith himself criticizes the division of labor, suggesting that it leads to the dulling of talent — that workers become ignorant and insular as their roles are confined to a few repetitive tasks. By contrast, generalist roles provide all the things that drive job satisfaction: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. . Organisations that can employ new managerial practices designed to nurture creatives, will grow their business and nurture talent in their employees. .",

            "title": "Just Right Engineering",
            "content": "Everyone in tech loves to hate on the over-engineers or the under-engineers. . Over-engineers say: . Software engineering is declining! | No one understands underlying hardware or algorithms anymore! | No one truly understands this system, look at their dependencies! They depend on millions of lines of code! | I’ll write huge style guides, set up technical committees, gatekeep all code changes and re-write the whole system from scratch. Then everything will be great and I’ll finally sleep at night. | . Under-engineers say: . Git sucks! Code reviews suck! OOP sucks! Architectural design sucks! | Everyone is wasting their time, just throw something together and push it out! | I love hacking, I’ll spend all evening and weekends doing it, I’m always happy to jump on top of my bugs to squash them :^) | . Tech draws in people who are super passionate about theory or super passionate about application. . The middle ground is left frustratingly empty. . The art of engineering is in choosing the right pattern at the right time for the right problem. . Both over-engineers and under-engineers are guilty of ignoring this art. . The meta-problem here is how does one solve a problem. . Both parties treat the meta-problem as solved. . In reality, they’re both doing what they find most fun, and aren’t even trying to solve the meta-problem. . They’re applying a one-size fits all approach, projecting out the world they want to exist; but the reality is: . Life is nuanced . All good software engineering tools, techniques and paradigms are there to enable you to handle the appropriate level of complexity. . An over-engineer will completely fail to launch a simple project and so in that context won’t deliver anything of value. . But their mindset may be what is needed for say; a clinical grade medical device running on embedded devices. . An under-engineer will completely fail to improve a vast complex system and so in that context won’t deliver anything of value. . But their mindset may be what is needed for say; building a new fan site for a buzzing hot topic, where time is of the essence, and flare is more valued by users than robustness. . So all engineers can be “just right engineers” by moving to an appropriate environment. But in practice very few will slot into a perfect role for their default make-up. . The engineers I respect most are those who adapt to their environment. . Just right engineers say: . This approach would have huge value, but requires huge investment. The return on investment is too low, so we will not use it at this point of time | This approach is high risk, high reward. There are no low risk, high rewards alternatives; so lets commit. | We are currently using an approach that would enable future functionality we would love to build, but we don’t know if / when we will build it; and for now it is adding huge overhead to our process holding us back. We will drop it for now. | We have not invested in tooling, and now that we are scaling it is massively holding us back; time to commit to building these enablers | . The key being applying the art of engineering . Avoiding doing something too soon or too late . Following the nuances of life . Moving fast enough that you take action to shake out unknown unknowns . Moving slow enough to observe the consequences of your actions, and spot opportunity to enhance productivity . All software engineering should be a balancing act between committing to deliver value now and increasing your future ability to deliver value .",

            "title": "How to Build Wealth",
            "content": "Money shapes our lives. . We spend 80,000 hours working to earn money. . We spend many more spending it or simply worrying about it. . Everyone needs financial literacy to get through life. . Yet we are not taught the basics of how to handle money. . There are three simple, (not easy, but simple) steps to build wealth: . Spend less than you earn | Avoid debt | Invest the rest | Wealth . Wealth gives you freedom to take risks. . If you can take risks, you can: . Change jobs | Demand better pay from your boss | Pursue work that makes you happy | Take time between jobs to organise your life | . Taking these risks will improve your life and increase your income. . More Wealth means more Freedom . More Freedom means more Chances . More Chances means more Income . More Income means more Wealth . More Chances makes a Happier Life . Spend Less Than You Earn . If you spend more than you earn, you&#39;re spiralling towards bankruptcy. . If you spend exactly what you earn, then you&#39;ll be a slave to your job forever. . If you spend less than you earn, you can build wealth. . There are two ways to spend less than you earn: . Earn more (without spending more) | Spend less (without earning less) | &quot;A penny saved is better than a penny earned&quot; - A financially literate grandmother . Cutting spending is more effective and is often easier than increasing earnings. . For the median UK earner, because of tax: . Earning an extra £1 per year, increases their wealth by 84p per year | Saving an extra £1 per year, increases their wealth by £1 per year | . Spending less also makes what you have go further. . In terms of financial freedom, halving your spending is the same as doubling your earnings. . I recommend Mr Money Moustache&#39;s Blog if you&#39;re interesting in spending less. . He is challenging, funny and extremely effective at cutting spending. . Avoid Debt . It is pointless saving or investing if you have debt. . Debt is incredibly powerful. . It will wipe out the value of any savings or investments you have. . It will prevent you from ever gaining any wealth. . Debt uses the same principles that powers investments, but instead of working for you it works against you. . The average interest for UK credit card debt is 19% . The average interest for UK savings accounts is 1.2% . The expected returns for investing in the market is ~7% . The difference in growth is exceptional. . The graph below shows what happens to £1000 worth of debt, savings and investment, left untouched for 20 years. . Once you have no debt, start saving. . To avoid debt it is important to have an emergency cash fund. . As a rule of thumb: have enough cash to cover a few month&#39;s expenditure. . If you need to spend money, always use savings. Never take on debt. . If you have no savings and have to take on debt, pay it off ASAP. . Use your surplus cash to relentlessly pay off debt. . Start with the highest interest loans. . Student loans and mortgages are special cases . In the UK student loans are more similar to a graduate tax than debt . Mortgages are leveraged investments . Invest The Rest . The government has many schemes to encourage saving and investing. . In my experience it often does the opposite. . To safely invest, you need to understand: . Types of accounts with their: Eligibility rules | Deposit rules | Withdrawal rules | Tax implications | Various charges | . | Types of investments with their: Volatility | Diversification | Liquidity | Potential for growth | . | . You then need to choose your investment platforms and sift through platform specific funds etc. . People either make a jab with partial knowledge or give up trying. . Below is my overview of these points and my broad-brush advice. See the disclaimer. . Types of Investment Accounts . When it comes to types of accounts it makes sense to: . Maximise your employer pension contribution (this requires a minimum investment from you) | Max out a Lifetime ISA, if you&#39;re eligible and will buy a house or stay invested until you&#39;re 60 | Open a Stocks and Shares ISA and invest up to £16k-20k per year | If you still have spare cash (lucky you!) invest in a standard investment account | When choosing which accounts to use, you must trade-off between potential growth and flexibility. . Pension . Most people are unable to withdraw from their pension account until they are at least 55 years old. This makes it the least flexible investment account. . Pensions enable the highest returns because: . Your pension gets invested before income tax | By law, your employer must pay you more if you save in your pension | The money you would have paid as income tax earns interest while invested. You will get to keep this interest. . You will have to pay income tax when withdrawing from your pension. But if you have no or little other income when you withdraw, you will get to take advantage of your tax free personal allowance. . If you save 5% of your pre-tax income in your pension, then you employer must pay you an additional 3% of your salary, which goes straight into your pension. . This is the minimum, many employers are more generous and will give you an even bigger pay rise. . The graph below shows the difference in your return on investment if you invest: . In your pension with employer contributions | In your pension without employer contributions (e.g. after maxing out your employer&#39;s offer) | In an ISA with your extra take home pay (what would have went into your pension) | Assumptions This assumes all investments have an identical return of 7% per year. The values used for the plot are based on the median UK salary of £15.38 per hour and the median UK working hours of 37 hours per week. Other incomes within the same tax bracket should have equivalent differences. This assumes the earner has an employer who contributes the minimum required by law to their employee&#39;s pension. This means a contribution equal to the value of 3% of the employee&#39;s pre-tax salary, excluding the first £6250 of earnings. As required to trigger the minimum employer contribution, the employee is assumed to contribute 5% of their pre-tax salary, excluding the first £6250 of earnings. The calculations take into account income tax and national insurance, assuming the employee&#39;s salary is their only income. If you earn the UK median salary, and you decide to save nothing in your pension you will have an extra £934 per year in your pocket. . If you take advantage of the 5% employee, 3% employer incentive you will get £1868 per year in your pension. . Lifetime ISA . A LISA is a government scheme to encourage investment and first time home buying. . It is more accessible than a pension but also has lots of rules around eligibility, deposits and withdrawals. . You cannot open a LISA if you&#39;re younger than 18 or older than 39. . You should definitely invest in a Lifetime ISA if you plan to buy your first home (which you should only do for lifestyle reasons). . It also makes sense if you have maxed out your employer pension contribution and plan to keep this money invested until you&#39;re 60. . You pay into a LISA with your after tax income. . You can contribute up to £4k per year until you&#39;re 50 years old. (But you must open an account before you&#39;re 40). . The government adds 25% to your investment. If you&#39;re a basic rate tax payer, this is equivalent to a refund on your income tax. . In this case it will perform the same as an employee only pension contribution. . Explanation If you have £100 before income tax and pay the basic rate of 20% you will receive £80. If you invest this £80 in a LISA the government will add 25%, bringing your account balance to £100. You can withdraw from this account fee free if: . You&#39;re over 60 | You&#39;re a first time home buyer using this money towards a deposit | . You can withdraw money at any time for any other reason, but you will pay a fee. . The fee is usually equivalent to losing ~6% of your investment. . Explanation If you invest £80 in a LISA the government will add 25%, bringing your account balance to £100. If you withdraw money without meeting the criteria, you will have to pay a 25% charge, leaving you with £75. This is 93.75% of the original £80. Investing in a LISA and withdrawing fee free is much better than investing in a normal ISA. . Investing in a normal ISA is marginally better than a LISA with fees. . Investing in a LISA and withdrawing with fees is much better than not investing. . So don&#39;t let the fees put you off too much! . ISA . You can invest up to £20k per year in an ISA. . Any investments in a Lifetime ISA count towards this total, so if you max out your LISA, you can invest up to £16k in a normal ISA. . Standard Investment Account . In a standard investment account you may have to pay taxes on the interest you earn. . You may pay tax every year based on the increase in value. . You may have to pay capital gains tax when you withdraw your cash. . ISAs are preferable so that taxes aren&#39;t a concern. . Types of Investment . You can invest in: . Company stock - you own a percentage of a company | Bonds - you own the debt of governments or companies | Property | Commodities - you own natural resources like gold, oil or grain | . Each of these has its own: . Volatility | Liquidity | Potential for growth | Minimum investment | . An investment is volatile if its price changes dramatically over short periods of time. . An investment is liquid if you can easily turn it into cash. . Company Stock . Volatily: High | Liquidity: High | Potential for growth: High | Minimum investment: Low | . Bonds . Volatily: Low | Liquidity: Medium | Potential for growth: Low | Minimum investment: Low | . Property . Volatily: Low | Liquidity: Very Low | Potential for growth: Medium | Minimum investment: Very High | . Commodities . Volatily: Low | Liquidity: Medium | Potential for growth: Low | Minimum investment: Medium | . Single Investments vs Investment Funds . You could invest in a single company, bond, house or commodity, but . Investing in a single asset is very high risk. . Diversification is how you protect yourself against unpredictable changes that affect single types of assets. . Don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket. . You can actively pick many individual investments that sound promising to you. . Don&#39;t do this. To have a chance you would need to dedicate your career to it. . Even then, over a 10+ year period you will do worse than if you just spread your investment across the market. . There is a reason Warren Buffet is famous. He is one of the only people who has successfully beat the market. Almost everyone else lost, while working hard for the privilege. . Don&#39;t try to beat the market. Join it. . The solution is investment funds. . They spread your money across many individual assets. . You can choose funds with different scopes for different types of assets; such as different sectors of the economy, different countries, different lengths of investment etc. . If you want to maximise diversity you can spread your investment across all publicly traded companies and bonds. . Active funds have paid professionals regularly changing what they invest your money in. . Passive index funds spread your investment proportionally across your investment class, representing the full market. . Passive index funds beat active funds and have much lower fees. . They should be your investing bread and butter. . Passive vs Active In any given year 80% of actively managed funds do worse than their index. A Vanguard study showed that over a 15 year timespan 45% of actively managed funds failed, another 37% did worse than their index, with only 18% outperforming it. Over a 30 year timespan 99.4% of actively managed funds failed or underperformed their index. Financial Independence . When you work you give up your time in exchange for money. . When you save and invest, you give up what you could buy now in exchange for financial security. . As shown earlier, the power of compound interest is what makes this deal attractive. . Every bit of wealth gains you more autonomy, and if you save and invest enough, you can become completely financially independent. . This means you have enough wealth that the interest it earns covers your cost of living. . It means you can no longer be forced to work out of necessity. . It means you can focus on what&#39;s important to you. Whether that&#39;s your family, your hobbies or even continuing a career, but on your own terms. . This is true &quot;F*** You&quot; money. . The rule of thumb for calculating FU money, is to multiply your cost of living by 25. . Explanation The authors of the &quot;Trinity Study&quot; investigated what percentage of their assets a retiree could withdraw every year for 30 years, without becoming bankrupt. Looking at the data for 30 years retirements spanning the years 1925-1995 they found this value fluctuated between 4% and 8.5%. If your wealth equals 25 times your cost of living, then withdrawing 4% of your wealth will cover your expenditure. Note: If you landed on a lucky year and could safely withdraw 8.5% of your wealth, then you only need 11.76 times your expenditure, not 25 times, but you wouldn&#39;t know this until the years had passed. Lets take an example of Jill. Jill earns the UK average of £15.38 per hour and works the UK average of 37 hours per week. . She has been good at controlling her expenditure, and spends what would be her take home pay if she earned minimum wage. . This means savings of ~£10k per year and cost of living of ~£14.6k a year, for a savings rate of ~40%. . The average working life in the EU is 36 years. . If Jill didn&#39;t invest she could only reach FU money as she retired. . But thanks to investing Jill has many choices. . She could carry on working the same job and retire with £1.6 million instead of £370k | She could enjoy retirement a whole 18 years earlier than planned | She could work for only 10 years then switch to part time work | . Her investments give her opportunities to control her life. . How To Build Wealth . Spend less than you earn | Avoid debt | Invest the rest | Investment guidelines: . Invest in passive index funds | For highest growth choose stocks | For highest diversification choose a global fund | To balance growth and liquidity fill your accounts in this order: Pension | LISA | ISA | Standard Investment Account | . | . If you get even part way through this list you&#39;re well on your way to growing your: . Wealth | Freedom | Chances | Income | Happiness | . Inequality . I believe the lack of financial education is a huge driver of inequality in our society. . The wealthy are taught about money; through family and friends. . The wealthless are left to hash it out on their own. . People are driven to buy a single house through the folklore that surrounds them. . And the opportunity cost is huge. . People spend years uninvested saving up the huge deposit required; even though this is less effective, riskier and less accessible than investing in an index fund. . The steps for building wealth highlight why inequality is accelerating: . Spending less than you earn is easiest for those on high incomes | Avoiding debt is easiest for the wealthy | Effectively investing the rest requires financial knowledge | . But with the right knowledge, it is possible for anyone to do all three. . Disclaimer . I am not a financial advisor.

            "title": "Why You Shouldn't Buy a House",
            "content": "Buying a house is the worst decision I nearly made. . I nearly did it because it is what people expect me to do. . It seems sensible too. . You’re paying for your landlord’s retirement. . Being a landlord is profitable. . They’re obviously profitable at your expense. . Your parents and grandparents tell you their homes are worth 5-10x what they paid. . They’re horrified by your rent. . Their mortgage repayments are a fraction of this. . All of this is true. . If you buy a house you will save hundreds of thousands of pounds over your lifetime, versus doing nothing. . You don’t have to do nothing . If you’re considering buying a house for financial reasons, there are alternatives that are: . More effective AND | Less risky AND | Easier (including more accessible) | I knew there were lifestyle reasons to not buy a house, but I thought the financial gain was worth the sacrifice. . I was not aware of these alternatives. . Researching the alternatives changed my perspective of housing and changed my mind. . It might change yours too . Housing Folklore . When I wanted to buy a house, I missed that I was looking for an investment. . I did not understand that houses are just like any other investment. . There’s a lot of folk-lore and spin surrounding housing in the UK and USA. . People commonly say rent is “throwing away” your money, which they don’t say about other spending. . People talk about about climbing the “property ladder”. . Politicians talk about generations who get “left behind” because they couldn’t get on that first rung. . No one talks about other types of investment “ladders”. . No one points out that it is the lack of general savings and investments (and other systematic factors) that holds back social mobility. . There is nothing specific about houses. . Placing a deposit on a house is an alternative to investing that deposit. . Placing a deposit on a house is the same as investing that deposit. . Placing a deposit on a house is less effective, riskier, harder and restricts your life more than investing that deposit. . It isn’t only home-owners and landlords that grow their wealth. . I think the reason we miss this is that buying a house feels familiar and comfortable. . If I bought a house then wanted to move but keep my investment; becoming a landlord would also feel familiar and comfortable. . Cash and houses. They’re part of normal life. . I didn’t understand that holding cash is an investment (a terrible one at that). . I knew nothing of bonds or REITs. . Stocks are what crazy gung-ho risk takers gamble on with their millions right? . To me, these were intimidating ideas, not accessible to someone like me. . None of my friends or family know much about investing. . Their only investments are their houses and their pensions. . Pensions are black box magic. . Many view them as a special savings account the government tops up. . Houses are long term homes. . They happen to have a side effect of building equity. . I didn’t know that we all* own stocks, bonds and REITs through our pensions already. . A stock is partial ownership of a company. You are entitled to part of their profits. . A bond is ownership of someone else’s debt. You are entitled to full repayment of this loan with interest. You can sell ownership of this loan before it is fully repaid. . A REIT is a Real Estate Investment Trust. Through this trust you have partial ownership of real estate. This is usually commerical property but may include residential property. . When you are younger, your pension will mostly be a diversified set of stocks. These are the best asset for growing your wealth. . As you get older your pension shifts to bonds. . These are less volatile than stocks. They are better at maintaining any existing wealth. . This is important as you approach retirement having added money throughout your career. . Finally your pension shifts to cash so you can withdraw and spend it. . Thanks to Index Funds, we can all benefit from this process without knowing much anything about it. . A normal person with very limited financial knowledge can put their money in an index fund and study after study shows they’ll beat Wall Street traders over a 10+ year period. . I want to show how buying assets in an index fund is more effective, less risky AND easier than buying a house. . Easier . Investing in an index fund (once you know what they are and how to choose one) is as easy as opening a savings account. . For example: . Register with Vanguard online | Transfer money into your account (current minimum lump sum investment is £500) | Invest it into a LifeStrategy fund choosing the balance between stocks and bonds based on how long you will keep your money invested | . Investing in a house is famously one of the most stressful and difficult things you will ever do. . Ranked more stressful than having a baby . You need to: . Save a large sum of cash (orders of magnitudes larger than £500) | Get pre-approved for a mortgage via a mortgage broker | Optionally find a real estate agent | House hunt | Submit an offer &amp; haggle / compete with other bidders | Organise professional home inspection and appraisal | Final paperwork, pay closing costs, property tax, transaction fees, get insurance… | Move house | . This process takes months and can be further stalled by: . Struggling to find a suitable house | Mortgage application rejection | Losing out on a bid (including getting Gazumped after your offer was accepted) | Bad results from a professional home inspection | Sellers pulling out of the deal | Broken property chain | Down-valuation by lender | . Common reasons for mortgage application rejection: . You recently changed jobs | You’re not registered to vote | Administrative errors on your credit file | You don’t match the lenders target demographic | Your income is too low (counted after tax and deductions even if you could reduce deductions such as your pension contribution) | You’re self employed or a contractor | You recently applied for a credit card | You took a payday loan in the last 6 years | Your deposit is too small | . Less Risky . Investing in an index fund is less risky than investing in a house. . Diversification . Diversification is the key to managing risk. . “Don’t Put All Your Eggs in One Basket” - A wise grandmother . A house could not be less diverse. . It is in a single country, county/state, city/town, neighbourhood, street… . The value of your house will be affected by anything from global events to something a single neighbour does. . When you buy a house you’re also buying a single type of house (apartment, semi-detached, detached), with a certain style (open-plan, large windows…). . The prices for these will fluctuate based on fashion. . Index funds automatically diversify your investment. . This Global Stocks Index Fund invests in over 6700 companies spanning more than 42 countries. . This Global Bonds Index Fund spreads over 4900 debtors which include governments, companies, agencies etc. . This Global REIT Index Fund invests in many properties in more than 10 countries. . You cannot be any more diversified than that. . Everyone knows it’s risky to buy stocks in a single company. . Everyone ignores that it’s risky to invest in a single house. . Liquidity . Saying an investment is liquid or illiquid is a fancy way of saying it’s easy or hard to turn it into cash. . You need liquidity to deal with unexpected emergencies. . You never know when something bad will happen that requires a lot of cash. . You may be out of a job for a long time. . You may suddenly need to support a dependent. . All your belongings may spontaneously combust and need replaced. . A house is incredibly illiquid. . You cannot turn the money you invested into your house into cash as needed. . To access this money as cash you have to sell your house. . This takes months and involves a massive life upheaval. . More Effective . The stock market has historically grown at a higher rate than house prices. . The trick to take advantage of this is to set up a standing order to invest regularly and ignore scare-mongering financial news stories. . Leave it alone, forget about it, feel no stress and you’re set to go. . Sustaining the returns from a house requires lots of effort and stress. . To simply stop your house from decreasing in value you must carry out repairs, maintenance, redecoration and general home improvements. . This additional investment means that house prices do not reflect the whole story, and the return on investment for home ownership is lower than house prices suggest. . House prices don’t take into account additional costs required for maintenance. . Stock prices don’t take into account additional returns on investment you receive through dividends. . Dividends are your share of the company’s profits. . But what about recessions? . The Great Depression started with the worst stock market crash. . If you were extraordinarily unlucky and invested only at the peak before the crash, your investment would have recovered in 7.5 years. . If your luck was even slightly better, investing before and after the peak (especially during the trough), you would have your money back much much quicker. . That was the worst stock market crash we have ever had. . House prices are also affected by recessions. . The huge decrease in house prices caused the Great Recession of 2007/2008. . People over-valued houses just as they often over value companies, and the bubble burst when they realised the prices had got out of hand. . If you’re willing to keep your money invested in a house for a long time, then you should be willing to do the same with stocks to ride out these bumps. . Lifestyle . So buying a house is one of the most stressful things you can do, it is ridiculously difficult; it is a risky investment; and it performs worse than alternatives. . So why might you buy a house? . For lifestyle reasons: . You enjoy DIY, and your landlord prevents you from getting your hands dirty on home projects (it is possible to find landlords who will allow this) | You want to live in the same location for a very long period of time, setting down roots, being part of the community, building a sentimental attachment to your home (still possible while renting, but there is a risk the landlord will evict you) | You want to live in a specific location / in a specific style of house and cannot find something that meets this criteria on the rental market (a problem I’m currently facing) | You have found a house that is undervalued to such a degree it makes up for the financial downsides and lifestyle restrictions (you must know something no one else does or be incredibly lucky) | You want a pet, cannot find somewhere to rent that allows pets and are willing to make huge sacrifices to have one (my girlfriend) | You have a history of terrible landlords and desperately need to take back control | . Buying a house does not make sense if: . You don’t want to maintain a house | You want the flexibility to move locations, such as to other towns/cities/countries (or away from bad neighbourhoods) | You want to adjust the size of your house as needed | You want to get upgrades to appliances and decor with limited disruption (assuming moving to a newly refurbished house is less disruption than refurbishing one you live in) | You want to (relatively) easily build wealth | . Further Reading . The first time I questioned my decision to buy a house was when I read Why your house is a terrible investment by JL Collins. . That article also sparked my interest in learning about investments. . The same author has written a Stock Series of articles, discussing investments (primarily stocks but also bonds and REITs) which was so popular he used it as a basis for his book The Simple Path to Wealth. . JL Collins is popular in the Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE) movement. . Reading about this led me to discover other interesting figures in the world of personal finance such as Mr Money Moustache. . The leading figures in this community have interesting ideas that challenge the norm. . If you believe buying a house will be a more effective investment, and you’re not put off by the difficulty, the risk and the lifestyle impacts, I would recommend running the numbers. . Renting Is Throwing Money Away … Right? runs through the complicated process of modelling your expected returns vs the alternatives. The conclusion is as with everything, it depends. Namely on: price to rent ratio, time invested, assumptions about inflation, expected costs, how fast rents increase etc. etc. . JL Collins also has a run the numbers with links to many other articles that aim to do the same. . At the time of writing interest rates in the UK are at 0.1%. I assumed this means it is a great time to buy a house, as mortgages could hardly be cheaper. . Ten Reasons It’s A Terrible Time To Buy An Expensive House made me realise that of course it’s not that simple! . The author states that it’s better to buy with a high interest rate. . The theory goes that a low interest rate causes house prices to rise. Prices will fall when interest rates rise, which we assume will happen eventually given how ridiculously low they currently are. . When house prices fall, you lose your equity but not your debt. . Markets aren’t so simple, who knew :man_shrugging: . Disclaimer . I am not a financial advisor. Please assess your own financial situation and carry out your own research / seek professional financial advice as required. . I simply hope to provoke your thoughts :) .",

          "content": "Hi, my name is Robbie. . I plan to sporadically write about my interests, which include: . Personal finance | Data science | Software engineering | Economics | Bioinformatics | Leadership | Product development | Philosophy | People/places/food | . Many of these tie in with my current career path, others with my personal life, and the rest are included out of pure curiosity. . Machine Learning for Healthcare . The recent advances in machine learning will have a huge impact on drug discovery, cancer diagnostics and research. As with all technological leaps forward, it will require an overhaul in the way of working for all those in the field. . I’ve spent the past few years working on digital and computational pathology, and hope to help make that transition happen as fast and as effectively as possible. . My main focus is on applying computer vision techniques to images of digitised biopsies. This can free up the valuable time of clinicians and researchers by automating tedious tasks; but what will be really transformative are the new insights that are not possible without automation. . Finance . My interest in personal finance has came from planning to buy a house and changing my mind thanks to discovering the Financial Independence community or FIRE movement. . Nerdisms . An interest in politics, led to an interest in economics, which led to an interest in philosophy. Philosophy spiked my interest in how to think, which recently led to Epistemology (knowledge about knowledge). . These are super-meta subjects I find it fun to think about. I have limited knowledge about them, but I hope exploring them and writing about them can refine my thoughts. . Contact Me .
