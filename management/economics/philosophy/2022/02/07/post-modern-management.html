    <p>Market conditions are forcing us to make a break with managerial practices of the past.</p>

<p>Labour’s efficiency growth has been dominating productivity since the industrial revolution.
Previously, investments in physical capital (such as roads) drove productivity.</p>

<p>The industrial revolution marked the moment when there was humongous growth of output per worker, without the corresponding investment in physical capital.</p>

<p>This has been driven by an era of industrial capitalism, characterised by the division of labour to enable specialisation and the routinisation of work tasks.</p>

<p>As the non-creative parts of tasks become disentangled from the creative parts, they can increasingly be made more efficient by applying standardised processes, semi-automation and eventually total automation.</p>

<p>These efficiency gains apply a selection pressure, driving further splitting of tasks into creative and non-creative parts.</p>

<p>In the modern era following the industrial revolution the creativity in business was done at the strategic management level of existing businesses or by entrepreneurs for new businesses.</p>

<p>An entrepreneur would discover a re-arrangement of tasks that enabled these efficiency protocols, and setup an organisation to exploit this discovery to undercut their competitors in the market, or to enable the birth of a new market that was previously economically inaccessible.
E.g. <a href="https://science.jrank.org/pages/558/Assembly-Line-History.html">Henry Ford inspired by the “dis-assembly” line in a slaughterhouse, setup an assembly line for automobile construction.</a></p>

<p>Managers hire non-creative labour to plug the holes in the process where creative and non-creative work are still coupled, or where an economically viable, totally automated solution for some non-creative work has not yet been found.</p>

<p>In the past, creatives were ignored if they had no power / authority. They head no means by which to enact their creations.
Only those with financial backing and social status could bring their creations to life in broad markets, often employing labourers.</p>

<p>As technology has advanced, we continue to discover ever more efficient methodologies and build ever more powerful tools.
This has led to reorganisations occurring and non-creative work vanishing at an astonishing rate.</p>

<p>A positive feedback loop has been kicked off. New efficiencies, lead to more efficently discovering new efficiencies.</p>

<p>Discovering and implementing efficiencies enables us to discover and implement meta-efficiencies.</p>

<p>As the discovery of efficiency protocols accelerates, non-creative labour is disappearing and new creative work is being created.</p>

<p>That being, the creative work of generating these efficiency protocols.</p>

<p>Labour is increasingly shifting to be the process of creatively disrupting existing labour.</p>

<p>Strategic management continues to be creative, but the growth in creativity is happening with the labourers; and management is struggling to adapt to this change.</p>

<p>To creatively generate efficiency protocols, a holistic overview of the whole system is required.
Specialisation and tight focus hinders creativity.
Generalism and holism drives creativity.</p>

<p>This contrasts sharply with the methodology of the division of labour that drove modern industrial capitalism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://hbr.org/2019/03/why-data-science-teams-need-generalists-not-specialists">The goal of [creatives] is not to execute. Rather, the goal is to learn and develop profound new business capabilities.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The managerial practices of the modern era are becoming increasingly defunct in our contemporary post-modern or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamodernism">metamodern</a> society.</p>

<p>Organisations that employ modernist managerial practices will stifle the business innovation and employee growth required to compete in an increasingly creative market.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Adam Smith himself criticizes the division of labor, suggesting that it leads to the dulling of talent — that workers become ignorant and insular as their roles are confined to a few repetitive tasks.
By contrast, generalist roles provide all the things that drive job satisfaction: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The future is owned by organisations that can employ new managerial practices designed to nurture creatives.</p>

<p>Organisations that can nurture holism within individuals.</p>

<p>Organisations that can have all as one, and one as all.</p>

<p>Organisations that can drive meta-efficiencies.</p>
