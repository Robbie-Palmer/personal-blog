    <p>Everyone in tech loves to hate on the over-engineers or the under-engineers.</p>

<p>Over-engineers say:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Software engineering is declining!</li>
  <li>No one understands underlying hardware or algorithms anymore!</li>
  <li>No one <em>truly</em> understands this system, look at their dependencies! They depend on millions of lines of code!</li>
  <li>I’ll write huge style guides, set up technical committees,
gatekeep all code changes and re-write the whole system from scratch.
Then everything will be great and I’ll finally sleep at night.</li>
</ul>

<p>Under-engineers say:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Git sucks! Code reviews suck! OOP sucks! Architectural design sucks!</li>
  <li>Everyone is wasting their time, just throw something together and push it out!</li>
  <li>I love hacking, I’ll spend all evening and weekends doing it, I’m always happy to jump on top of my bugs to squash
them :^)</li>
</ul>

<p>Tech draws in people who are super passionate about theory or super passionate about application.</p>

<p>The middle ground is left frustratingly empty.</p>

<p>The art of engineering is in choosing the right pattern at the right time for the right problem.</p>

<p>Both over-engineers and under-engineers are guilty of ignoring this art.</p>

<p>The meta-problem here is how does one solve a problem.</p>

<p>Both parties treat the meta-problem as solved.</p>

<p>In reality, they’re both doing what they find most fun, and aren’t even trying to solve the meta-problem.</p>

<p>They’re applying a one-size fits all approach, projecting out the world they want to exist; but the reality is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Life is nuanced</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All good software engineering tools, techniques and paradigms are there to enable you to handle the appropriate level of
complexity.</p>

<p>An over-engineer will completely fail to launch a simple project and so in that context won’t deliver anything of value.</p>

<p>But their mindset may be what is needed for say; a clinical grade medical device running on embedded devices.</p>

<p>An under-engineer will completely fail to improve a vast complex system and so in that context won’t deliver anything of
value.</p>

<p>But their mindset may be what is needed for say; building a new fan site for a buzzing hot topic, where time is of
the essence, and flare is more valued by users than robustness.</p>

<p>So all engineers can be “just right engineers” by moving to an appropriate environment.
But in practice very few will slot into a perfect role for their default make-up.</p>

<p>The engineers I respect most are those who adapt to their environment.</p>

<p>Just right engineers say:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This approach would have huge value, but requires huge investment. The return on investment is too low, so we will not
use it <em>at this point of time</em></li>
  <li>This approach is high risk, high reward. There are no low risk, high rewards alternatives; so lets commit.</li>
  <li>We are currently using an approach that would enable future functionality we would <em>love</em> to build, but we don’t know
if / when we will build it; and for now it is adding huge overhead to our process holding us back.
We will drop it for now.</li>
  <li>We have not invested in tooling, and now that we are scaling it is massively holding us back; time to commit to
building these enablers</li>
</ul>

<p>The key being applying the <strong>art of engineering</strong></p>

<p>Avoiding doing something too soon or too late</p>

<p>Following the nuances of life</p>

<p>Moving fast enough that you take action to shake out unknown unknowns</p>

<p>Moving slow enough to observe the consequences of your actions, and spot opportunity to enhance productivity</p>

<p>All software engineering should be a balancing act between committing to deliver value <strong><em>now</em></strong> and increasing your
<strong><em>future</em></strong> ability to deliver value</p>
